I tried to get the homepage to look as close as possible to the one in the specs, which required me to use different font sizes. 
For the like, map-marker, and comment icons, I used them from the font awesome library.

I used 3 background-images for the different webpages:
- Louvre Entrace: [https://www.louvre.fr/en/explore/the-palace/a-pyramid-for-a-symbol]
- Dusk on Santorini: - [https://santorinibesttours.com/tours/imerovigli]
- Amsterdam Flower Market: - [https://www.amsterdam.net/en/things-to-do-amsterdam/bloemenmarkt/]
